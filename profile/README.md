# trackxf

This project is building a data exchange format for behavioural tracking experiments. There is currently no data-sharing format for behavioural tracking and no publicly-available data for re-analysis or replication studies. The *trackxf* standard aims to remedy this.

## Website
The project website can be found at [https://trackxf.org](https://trackxf.org).

## Code repository
The open-source code is available here on github in the repository [https://github.com/trackxf/trackxf](https://github.com/trackxf/trackxf).

## Schema
This project is still in development. The working version of the JSON schema is hosted at [https://github.com/trackxf/trackxf/blob/main/trackxf_schema_v0.json](https://github.com/trackxf/trackxf/blob/main/trackxf_schema_v0.json).
